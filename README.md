<h2>Resources Used</h2>

- Resource Groups
- Azure virtual networks and subnets
- Azure virtual machines (windows and linux)
  - Azure Network Security Groups (Firewall Resource)



<h2>Prerequisites</h2>


- All you need is a Azure Tenet and a subscription




<b/>
















First we'll create a Resource Group named RG-network-activities, region should be set to East US 2

- Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group, also select East US 2, for image Windows 10 22H, and a size that has 2vcpus attached to it.
     You're than going to click on networking section to change the name of the virtual network. Skip Disks, won't be doing anything there.

   - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and name it something entirely different from the virtual machine, than just click create.

- Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Virtual Networkâ€”the Virtual Network MUST BE THE SAME. Name the virutal machine linux-vm.
     The image will be Ubantu 22.04LTS - x64 gen2, Size will be 2vcpus.

    Password can be the same as the windows-vm 
 

  
- Next skip Disks and go to network section and ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet
