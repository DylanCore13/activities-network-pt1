- Create a Resource Group
- Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
   - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet
- Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Virtual Network—the Virtual Network MUST BE THE SAME.
   - Authentication type: Username/Password
- Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet
- End the lab, but keep both VMs for Part 2!
