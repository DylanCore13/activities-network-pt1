- Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
 



   - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and 


   
- Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Virtual Networkâ€”the Virtual Network MUST BE THE SAME.

     
   - Authentication type: Username/Password
 

  
- Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet





- End the lab, but keep both VMs for Part 2!
